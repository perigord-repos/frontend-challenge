# Frontend React challenge

## **Introduction**
We would like you to implement a web page, regarding the wireframes provided on the "specs" folder and the svg assets in the "assets" folder, with a tic-tac-toe game. 
Feel free to add the dependencies you might need to the project and structure it as you wish, so it's perfectly fine if you create it with create-react-app.

The layout should be responsive but you'll only need to guarantee the game's correct behaviour in desktop. Feel also free to create your own (or bootstrap based) color scheme and design.

The only mandatory tech requirement is the usage of React >= 17.

Fork this repository, write your code and share it with us.
